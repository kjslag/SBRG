# SBRG
An implementation of the Spectrum Bifurcation Renormalization Group (SBRG) ([arXiv:1508.03635](http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.03635)) method in Haskell. This code was used in the following works: [arXiv:1604.04283](http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.04283) and [arXiv:1611.04058](http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04058).

Runtime and memory usage are linear (with log corrections) in the system size for an MBL system, and at most quadratic for a marginal MBL system.
